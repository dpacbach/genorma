TODO:

  * give location file a platform-specfic name

  * when make is run, look at the contents of the location
    file and update it but ONLY if we are in a new directoy.
    we must preserve the timestamp on this file otherwise.
    This must be done towards the beginning of the process
    before any other .d related things happen.
  * when make is traversing the tree, get a list of
    all .d files.
  * Create a rule (for each .d) file that will remake
    them if they are old relative to the location file,
    and the remaking will be done by the perl script
    (we can get rid of the shell script).
  * Rule should be written so that .d files can be adjusted
    in parallel.
  * Then, make will include the .d files as usual, however
    if any of them need to be remade, it will do so, and then
    reload itself.

  * Put version at top of make file, with the aim to reduce
    the build output to just a single makefile

  * see about getting rid of dependence on gmsl -- import any
    functions that are being used.

  * need to update nr-make CLI tool to use mono build
